# Independence Day 2 April Fools' Prank Script

## Overview

This repository houses the infamous script that turned every workstation in the visual effects team's floor for Independence Day 2: The Resurrection into a sea of blue screens, sparking moments of chaos and unforgettable laughter. Conceived by the brilliant minds of intern Deborah L and Senior Software Engineer Chris R, and immortalized by Scott B's impromptu videography, this script is a tribute to the lighter side of life in the high-pressure world of film production.

## Background

On April 1, 2012, with permission from the owners and thanks to a carefully orchestrated efforts of Deborah and Chris, and executed via the Deadline render manager, every workstation within 10 seconds displayed the dreaded BSOD, causing a wave of reactions ranging from "oh shit" to laughter. This moment of levity, captured on video by Scott B, remains a cherished memory for everyone involved, reminding us all of the importance of a little humor in our daily lives.

despite their seemingly boundless coding acumen, shall be absolved of all responsibility for any ensuing chaos. 
This includes, but is not limited to: roid rage, peripheral devices

This script is graciously conferred upon you 'as is', devoid of any assurance that it will not, on a whim, forsake its 
intended functions in favor of pursuing a career in digital arts. Should you opt to venture forth on this quixotic escapade, 
you do so entirely at your own risk, equipped solely with your intellect and, potentially, an unaccountable zest for adventure.

In the face of unanticipated digital maelstroms, take solace in the thought that the script's progenitors will be ensconced on 
an enigmatic shoreline, leisurely sipping tea whilst pondering over existential conundrums, blissfully detached from the digital 
havoc you might instigate.

Tread lightly, for the moment you actuate this script, 
its fate—and potentially the fate of your digital dominion—becomes irrevocably intertwined with your own.
